# EEG Challenge 
âœ¨ The overall challenge is "a general-purpose EEG foundation competition is needed to move beyond the one-task-per-model paradigm. A unified model could simultaneously decode both enduring mental traits and dynamic cognitive state" âœ¨

ðŸ§ **Challenge #1**: Cross-Task Transfer Learning Data ðŸ§ 
- Transferability across subjects and cognitive tasks
- Data from passive tasks â†’ active tasks
- More inclusive and accessible neurological exam


ðŸ§  **Challenge #2:** Psychopathology Factor Prediction ðŸ§ 
- Decoding psychopathology factor from the EEG
- Reduce potential inconsistencies and biases
- Enable early intervention and treatment
